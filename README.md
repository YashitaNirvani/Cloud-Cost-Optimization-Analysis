# Cloud-Cost-Optimization-Analysis
Cloud Cost Optimization in Analytics is a data analysis project focused on evaluating cloud billing data to identify high-cost services, usage inefficiencies, and potential cost-saving opportunities. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, cost aggregation, and visualization using Python to generate actionable business insights.

Project Overview

Cloud Cost Optimization in Analytics is a data analytics project focused on analyzing cloud billing data to identify cost drivers, usage patterns, and potential savings opportunities.
The objective of this project is to simulate a real-world business scenario where a company wants to reduce unnecessary cloud spending while maintaining performance and scalability.
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), cost aggregation, feature engineering, and visualization using Python.


Problem Statement

Organizations using cloud platforms often experience uncontrolled cost growth due to:
Underutilized resources
Excessive data transfer
Inefficient service allocation
Lack of cost monitoring dashboards
This project analyzes cloud billing datasets to:
Identify high-cost services
Detect unusual spending patterns
Analyze network usage impact on billing
Provide optimization recommendations
